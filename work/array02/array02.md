## Explanation of code

### using Hashing

I created a hash table set, then looped through the array. Also initialized sum to 0. As I go through the elements, I compare sum with the set to see if the sum is already in the set. If it is, then I return true. Or, if the sum is zero, then I return true. If not, then I add the element to the sum and add the sum to the set. If I get through the whole array without returning true, then I return false.

### using Sorting

I sorted the array, then looped through the array. Also initialized sum to 0.Then I nested the loop to loop progressively through the array. As I go through the element. if the sum is zero, then I return true. If not, then I add the element to the sum. If I get through the whole array without returning true, then I return false.
